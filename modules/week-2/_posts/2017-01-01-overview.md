# Week 2 Overview <br />Scratch Continues

In the first week we spent time discussing what creative coding is, looked at the command line, and introduced GitHub.com.  We also talked about Code.org and introduced Scratch. This week we will continue with Scratch and discuss how sprites can interact with one another and make a simple game. We will create communication between sprites, create variables and even our own blocks (which will be called methods soon).
